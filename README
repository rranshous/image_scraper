#Idea:
Create a set of applications which all pass state updates via events

#Goal
Create system of applications which can find / download / perminantly store images
which i want from the internet

#Pieces
- Image finders -- apps which find images and put off events announcing that they have been found
  events: image_found :: { src_page, src_url }

- Image downloader -- apps which download images to perminant storage
  events: image_downloaded :: { src_url, 
                                download_location, // name of download endpoint, ex: s3, local, etc
                                download_key } // unique id of image in download endpoint
